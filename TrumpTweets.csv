0,russia has informed us that they have removed most of their people from venezuela.
1,hearing word that russia syria and to a lesser extent iran are bombing the hell out of idlib province in syria and indiscriminately killing many innocent civilians. the world is watching this butchery. what is the purpose what will it get you? stop!
2,sean davis the federalist: “mueller proved his entire operation was a political hit job. still zero evidence of trump-russia collusion and no new evidence from mueller.”
3,russia russia russia! that’s all you heard at the beginning of this witch hunt hoax...and now russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected. it was a crime that didn’t exist. so now the dems and their partner the fake news media.....
4,russia russia russia! that’s all you heard at the beginning of this witch hunt hoax...and now russia has disappeared because i had nothing to do with russia helping me to get elected. it was a crime that didn’t exist. so now the dems and their partner the fake news media.....
5,“why doesn’t the press apologize to president trump for the russian collusion delusion?” how about the dems also?
6,democrat senator mark warner is acting and talking like he is in total control of the senate intelligence committee. their is nothing bipartisan about him. he should not be allowed to take “command” of that committee. too important! remember when he spoke to the russian jokester?
7,..between russia and the trump campaign. mr. mcgahn can be forgiven for declining the honor of appearing in mr. nadler’s pseudo-impeachment drama.” wall street journal editorial boardtoday - may
8,why are the democrats not looking into all of the crimes committed by crooked hillary and the phony russia investigation? they would get back their credibility. jerry nadler schiff would have a whole new future open to them. perhaps they could even run for president!
9,the mainstream media has never been as corrupt and deranged as it is today. fake news is actually the biggest story of all and is the true enemy of the people! that’s why they refuse to cover the real russia hoax. but the american people are wise to what is going on.....
10,....now the new big story is that trump made a lot of money and buys everything for cash he doesn’t need banks. but where did he get all of that cash? could it be russia? no i built a great business and don’t need banks but if i did they would be there...and deutschebank......
11,....and the democrat national committee-the democrat party apparatus-has been caught using donor dollars to collude with russian intelligence to attack a domestic political opponent (me). the fbi has no leadership. the director is protecting the same gang.....that tried to....
12,when the mueller report came out showing no collusion with russia (of course) it was supposed to be over back to work for the people. but the dems have gone “nuts” and it has actually gotten worse! hope the republicans win back the house in or little will get done!
13,think of it. i became president of the united states in one of the most hard fought and consequential elections in the history of our great nation. from long before i ever took office i was under a sick &amp; unlawful investigation concerning what has become known as the russian....
14,“everyone wants to know who needs to be accountable because it took up two years of our lives talking about this russian involvement. it proved no collusion &amp; people want to trace it back to see how this all happened?” treasonous hoax!
15,very good call yesterday with president putin of russia. tremendous potential for a good/great relationship with russia despite what you read and see in the fake news media. look how they have misled you on “russia collusion.” the world can be a better and safer place. nice!
16,when will the radical left wing media apologize to me for knowingly getting the russia collusion delusion story so wrong? the real story is about to happen! why is allowed to be on twitter &amp; facebook. much of what they do is fake news!
17,“they wanted to know what trump was up to with the russians - which of course is nonsense. this whole thing was a complete setup.” george papadopoulos to
18,had a long and very good conversation with president putin of russia. as i have always said long before the witch hunt started getting along with russia china and everyone is a good thing not a bad thing....
19,....we discussed trade venezuela ukraine north korea nuclear arms control and even the “russian hoax.” very productive talk!
20,ok so after two years of hard work and each party trying their best to make the other party look as bad as possible it’s time to get back to business. the mueller report strongly stated that there was no collusion with russia (of course) and in fact they were rebuffed.....
21,why didn’t president obama do something about russia in september (before november election) when told by the fbi? he did nothing and had no intention of doing anything!
22,“a very exculpatory section of the mueller report: no conspiracy coordination or collusion with the trump campaign and the russians. you can’t be more clear than that!”
23,the end result of the greatest witch hunt in u.s. political history is no collusion with russia (and no obstruction). pretty amazing!
24,the fake news media is doing everything possible to stir up and anger the pols and as many people as possible seldom mentioning the fact that the mueller report had as its principle conclusion the fact that there was no collusion with russia. the russia hoax is dead!
25,kimberley strassel should get the pulitzer. she is a treasure (and i don’t know her) who correctly called the russia hoax right from the start! others who were soooo wrong will get the prize. fake news!
26,“the mueller report is perhaps the single most humiliating thing that has ever happened to the white house press in the history of this country. they know they lied...many reporters lied about russia collusion and so much more. clapper &amp; brennan all lies”
27,anything the russians did concerning the election was done while obama was president. he was told about it and did nothing! most importantly the vote was not affected.
28,a must read andy mccarthy’s column today “dirty dealings of dirt devils who concocted trump-russia probe.” the greatest scam in political history. if the mainstream media were honest which they are not this story would be bigger and more important than watergate. someday!
29,the mueller report which was written by angry democrats who also happen to be trump haters (and clinton supporters) should have focused on the people who spied on my campaign and others who fabricated the whole russia hoax. that is never forget the crime.....
30,so it has now been determined by people that truly hate president trump that there was no collusion with russia. in fact it was an illegal investigation that should never have been allowed to start. i fought back hard against this phony &amp; treasonous hoax!
31,“the underlying issue remains the same without a single american being indicted for collusion with russia &amp; that is a stunning end considering we were led to believe (fake news) that something much more dramatic would happen. why did people fall for this?” molly h
32,“the reason the whole process seems so politicized is that democrats made up this complete lie about collusion ....and none of it happened.” charles hurt. the russian hoax never happened it was a fraud on the american people!
33,why should i be defending a fraudulent russian witch hunt. it’s about time the perpetrators of this fraud on me and the american people start defending their dishonest and treasonous acts. how and why did this terrible event begin? never forget!
34,.... against something i knew never existed collusion with russia (so ridiculous!) - no obstruction. this russia hoax must never happen to another president and law enforcement must find out how did it start?
35,according to polling few people seem to care about the russian collusion hoax but some democrats are fighting hard to keep the witch hunt alive. they should focus on legislation or even better an investigation of how the ridiculous collusion delusion got started - so illegal!
36,so funny that the new york times &amp; the washington post got a pulitzer prize for their coverage (% negative and fake!) of collusion with russia - and there was no collusion! so they were either duped or corrupt? in any event their prizes should be taken away by the committee!
37,robert mueller was a hero to the radical left democrats until he ruled that there was no collusion with russia (so ridiculous to even say!). after more than two years since the “insurance policy” statement was made by a dirty cop i got the answers i wanted the truth.....
38,.@greggjarrett: “trump-russia 'collusion' was always a hoax -- and dirtiest political trick in modern us history”
39,the mainstream media is under fire and being scorned all over the world as being corrupt and fake. for two years they pushed the russian collusion delusion when they always knew there was no collusion. they truly are the enemy of the people and the real opposition party!
40,“breaking news: mueller report finds no trump-russia conspiracy.”
41,“the special counsel did not find that the trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the russian government in these efforts despite multiple offers from russian-affiliated individuals to assist the trump campaign.”
42,“no matter your ideologies or your loyalties this is a good day for america. no american conspired to cooperate with russia in its efforts to interfere with the election according to robert mueller and that is good.”
43,“john solomon: as russia collusion fades ukrainian plot to help clinton emerges.”
44,....should federal election commission and/or fcc look into this? there must be collusion with the democrats and of course russia! such one sided media coverage most of it fake news. hard to believe i won and am winning. approval rating % % with republicans. sorry! #maga
45,....should never have been appointed and there should be no mueller report. this was an illegal &amp; conflicted investigation in search of a crime. russian collusion was nothing more than an excuse by the democrats for losing an election that they thought they were going to win.....
46,“the lisa page (fbi) transcript also confirms earlier reporting that page testified russian collusion was still unproven when special counsel robert mueller was appointed.” catherine herridge in other words they appointed someone when there was (and is) no crime. bad!
47,both the judge and the lawyer in the paul manafort case stated loudly and for the world to hear that there was no collusion with russia. but the witch hunt hoax continues as you now add these statements to house &amp; senate intelligence &amp; senator burr. so bad for our country!
48,now that they realize the only collusion with russia was done by crooked hillary clinton &amp; the democrats nadler schiff and the dem heads of the committees have gone stone cold crazy. letter sent to innocent people to harass them. they won’t get anything done for our country!
49,oh’ i see! now that the year russian collusion case has fallen apart there was no collusion except bye crooked hillary and the democrats they say “gee i have an idea let’s look at trump’s finances and every deal he has ever done. let’s follow discredited michael cohen.....
50,all false reporting (guessing) on my intentions with respect to north korea. kim jong un and i will try very hard to work something out on denuclearization &amp; then making north korea an economic powerhouse. i believe that china russia japan &amp; south korea will be very helpful!
51,the only collusion with the russians was with crooked hillary clinton and the democratic national committee...and where’s the server that the dnc refused to give to the fbi? where are the new texts between agent lisa page and her agent lover peter s? we want them now!
52,president xi of china has been very helpful in his support of my meeting with kim jong un. the last thing china wants are large scale nuclear weapons right next door. sanctions placed on the border by china and russia have been very helpful. great relationship with chairman kim!
53,highly respected senator richard burr head of senate intelligence said after interviewing over witnesses and studying over million pages of documents “we have found no collusion between the trump campaign and russia.” the witch hunt so bad for our country must end!
54,“if thinking that james comey is not a good fbi director is tantamount to being an agent of russia than just list all the people that are agents of russia - chuck schumer nancy pelosi rod rosenstein who wrote the memo to get rid of comey the inspector general....” trey gowdy
55,“after two years and interviewing more than two hundred witnesses the senate intelligence committee has not discovered any direct evidence of a conspiracy between the trump campaign and russia.” ken dilanian
56,disgraced fbi acting director andrew mccabe pretends to be a “poor little angel” when in fact he was a big part of the crooked hillary scandal &amp; the russia hoax - a puppet for leakin’ james comey. i.g. report on mccabe was devastating. part of “insurance policy” in case i won....
57,the senate intelligence committee: there is no evidence of collusion between the trump campaign and russia!
58,senator richard burr the chairman of the senate intelligence committee just announced that after almost two years more than two hundred interviews and thousands of documents they have found no collusion between trump and russia! is anybody really surprised by this?
59,the mainstream media has refused to cover the fact that the head of the very important senate intelligence committee after two years of intensive study and access to intelligence that only they could get just stated that they have found no collusion between “trump” &amp; russia....
60,not only did senator burr’s committee find no collusion by the trump campaign and russia it’s important because they interviewed witnesses and pages of documents &amp; the committee has direct access to intelligence information that’s classified.
61,highly respected senator richard burr chairman of senate intelligence said today that after an almost two year investigation he saw no evidence of russia collusion. “we don’t have anything that would suggest there was collusion by the trump campaign and russia.” thank you!
62,so now congressman adam schiff announces after having found zero russian collusion that he is going to be looking at every aspect of my life both financial and personal even though there is no reason to be doing so. never happened before! unlimited presidential harassment....
63,...big crooked hillary law firm represented by her lawyer michael sussmann (do you believe this?) who worked baker hard &amp; gave him oppo research for “a russia probe.” this meeting now exposed is the subject of senate inquiries and much more. an unconstitutional hoax.
64,former fbi top lawyer james baker just admitted involvement in fisa warrant and further admitted there were irregularities in the way the russia probe was handled. they relied heavily on the unverified trump “dossier” paid for by the dnc &amp; clinton campaign &amp; funded through a...
65,remember it was buzzfeed that released the totally discredited “dossier” paid for by crooked hillary clinton and the democrats (as opposition research) on which the entire russian probe is based! a very sad day for journalism but a great day for our country!
66,“gas prices drop across the united states because president trump has deregulated energy and we are now producing a great deal more oil than ever before.” but this is bad news for russia why would president trump do such a thing? thought he worked for kremlin?
67,....likewise do not want the kurds to provoke turkey. russia iran and syria have been the biggest beneficiaries of the long term u.s. policy of destroying isis in syria - natural enemies. we also benefit but it is now time to bring our troops back home. stop the endless wars!
68,i have been far tougher on russia than obama bush or clinton. maybe tougher than any other president. at the same time &amp; as i have often said getting along with russia is a good thing not a bad thing. i fully expect that someday we will have good relations with russia again!
69,how do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time done nothing wrong (no collusion with russia it was the dems that colluded) had the most successful first two years of any president and is the most popular republican in party history %?
70,“absolutely nothing” (on russian collusion). kimberley strassel the wall street journal. the russian collusion fabrication is the greatest hoax in the history of american politics. the only russian collusion was with hillary and the democrats!
71,there has never been a president who has been tougher (but fair) on china or russia - never just look at the facts. the fake news tries so hard to paint the opposite picture.
72,so hard to believe that lindsey graham would be against saving soldier lives &amp; billions of $$$. why are we fighting for our enemy syria by staying &amp; killing isis for them russia iran &amp; other locals? time to focus on our country &amp; bring our youth back home where they belong!
73,....russia iran syria &amp; many others are not happy about the u.s. leaving despite what the fake news says because now they will have to fight isis and others who they hate without us. i am building by far the most powerful military in the world. isis hits us they are doomed!
74,getting out of syria was no surprise. i’ve been campaigning on it for years and six months ago when i very publicly wanted to do it i agreed to stay longer. russia iran syria &amp; others are the local enemy of isis. we were doing there work. time to come home &amp; rebuild. #maga
75,michael isikoff was the first to report dossier allegations and now seriously doubts the dossier claims. the whole russian collusion thing was a hoax but who is going to restore the good name of so many people whose reputations have been destroyed?
76,....will never be proven and are likely false.” thank you to michael isikoff yahoo for honesty. what this means is that the fisa warrants and the whole russian witch hunt is a fraud and a hoax which should be ended immediately. also it was paid for by crooked hillary &amp; dnc!
77,russia dossier reporter now doubts dopey christopher steele’s claims! “when you get into the details of the steele dossier the specific allegations we have not seen the evidence to support them. there’s good grounds to think that some of the more sensational allegations.....
78,good luck today in court to general michael flynn. will be interesting to see what he has to say despite tremendous pressure being put on him about russian collusion in our great and obviously highly successful political campaign. there was no collusion!
79,....the russian witch hunt hoax started as the “insurance policy” long before i even got elected is very bad for our country. they are entrapping people for misstatements lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. nothing to do with collusion. a democrat scam!
80,wow texts between lisa page and her lover peter s of the fbi in charge of the russia hoax were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. such a big story that will never be covered by the fake news. witch hunt!
81,never in the history of our country has the “press” been more dishonest than it is today. stories that should be good are bad. stories that should be bad are horrible. many stories like with the real story on russia clinton &amp; the dnc seldom get reported. too bad!
82,james comey’s behind closed doors testimony reveals that “there was not evidence of campaign collusion” with russia when he left the fbi. in other words the witch hunt is illegal and should never have been started!
83,“democrats can’t find a smocking gun tying the trump campaign to russia after james comey’s testimony. no smocking gun...no collusion.” that’s because there was no collusion. so now the dems go to a simple private transaction wrongly call it a campaign contribution...
84,“this is collusion illusion there is no smoking gun here. at this late date after all that we have gone through after millions have been spent we have no russian collusion. there is nothing impeachable here.” time for the witch hunt to end!
85,without the phony russia witch hunt and with all that we have accomplished in the last almost two years (tax &amp; regulation cuts judge’s military vets etc.) my approval rating would be at % rather than the % just reported by rasmussen. it’s called presidential harassment!
86,i am certain that at some time in the future president xi and i together with president putin of russia will start talking about a meaningful halt to what has become a major and uncontrollable arms race. the u.s. spent billion dollars this year. crazy!
87,....lightly looked at doing a building somewhere in russia. put up zero money zero guarantees and didn’t do the project. witch hunt!
88,“this demonstrates the robert mueller and his partisans have no evidence not a whiff of collusion between trump and the russians. russian project legal. trump tower meeting (son don) perfectly legal. he wasn’t involved with hacking.” gregg jarrett. a total witch hunt!
89,based on the fact that the ships and sailors have not been returned to ukraine from russia i have decided it would be best for all parties concerned to cancel my previously scheduled meeting....
90,when will this illegal joseph mccarthy style witch hunt one that has shattered so many innocent lives ever end-or will it just go on forever? after wasting more than $ (is that possible?) it has proven only one thing-there was no collusion with russia. so ridiculous!
91,....hundreds of people closely involved with my campaign who never met saw or spoke to a russian during this period? so many campaign workers people inside from the beginning ask me why they have not been called (they want to be). there was no collusion &amp; mueller knows it!
92,the only “collusion” is that of the democrats with russia and many others. why didn’t the fbi take the server from the dnc? they still don’t have it. check out how biased facebook google and twitter are in favor of the democrats. that’s the real collusion!
93,emmanuel macron suggests building its own army to protect europe against the u.s. china and russia. but it was germany in world wars one &amp; two - how did that work out for france? they were starting to learn german in paris before the u.s. came along. pay for nato or not!
94,president macron of france has just suggested that europe build its own military in order to protect itself from the u.s. china and russia. very insulting but perhaps europe should first pay its fair share of nato which the u.s. subsidizes greatly!
95,you mean they are just now finding votes in florida and georgia – but the election was on tuesday? let’s blame the russians and demand an immediate apology from president putin!
96,rumor has it that senator joe donnelly of indiana is paying for facebook ads for his so-called opponent on the libertarian ticket. donnelly is trying to steal the election? isn’t that what russia did!?
97,the new york times has a new fake story that now the russians and chinese (glad they finally added china) are listening to all of my calls on cellphones. except that i rarely use a cellphone &amp; when i do it’s government authorized. i like hard lines. just more made up fake news!
98,for the record i have no financial interests in saudi arabia (or russia for that matter). any suggestion that i have is just more fake news (of which there is plenty)!
99,i met with the doj concerning the declassification of various unredacted documents. they agreed to release them but stated that so doing may have a perceived negative impact on the russia probe. also key allies’ called to ask not to release. therefore the inspector general.....
100,watch at : p.m. on russian hoax the big topic! mainstream media often referred to as the fake news media hates to discuss the real facts!
101,just watched sunday morning futures with on this show is mandatory watching if you want to understand the massive governmental corruption and the russian hoax. it will be rebroadcast this evening at : p.m. on a must see!
102,the illegal mueller witch hunt continues in search of a crime. there was never collusion with russia except by the clinton campaign so the angry democrats are looking at anything they can find. very unfair and bad for the country. also not allowed under the law!
103,while my (our) poll numbers are good with the economy being the best ever if it weren’t for the rigged russian witch hunt they would be points higher! highly conflicted bob mueller &amp; the angry democrats are using this phony issue to hurt us in the midterms. no collusion!
104,“the president has absolutely demonstrated no wrongdoing whatsoever &amp; that the special counsel has no evidence of any wrongdoing. in other words it’s time to end this witch hunt.” russian “collusion” was just an excuse by the democrats for having lost the election!
105,“we have found nothing to show collusion between president trump &amp; russia absolutely zero but every day we get more documentation showing collusion between the fbi &amp; doj the hillary campaign foreign spies &amp; russians incredible.”
106,president bashar al-assad of syria must not recklessly attack idlib province. the russians and iranians would be making a grave humanitarian mistake to take part in this potential human tragedy. hundreds of thousands of people could be killed. don’t let that happen!
107,“there is no possible way the trump tower meeting between don trump jr and a couple of russians who have very deep connections to both the clintons &amp; fusion gps &amp; where no information on the clintons was exchanged is a crime. dems are blinded by their hatred of trump.” bongino
108,“no information was ever given by the trump team to russia yet the hillary clinton campaign paid for information from kremlin sources and just washed it through an intermediary christopher steele.” jesse waters
109,....positions of power. that’s part of the story of the russia hoax. christopher steele is on the payroll of hillary clinton &amp; the fbi &amp; when they fired him for lying they continued to use him. violation of fbi regulations. kept trying to verify the unverifiable.”
110,the rigged russia witch hunt did not come into play even a little bit with respect to my decision on don mcgahn!
111,wow nellie ohr bruce ohr’s wife is a russia expert who is fluent in russian. she worked for fusion gps where she was paid a lot. collusion! bruce was a boss at the department of justice and is unbelievably still there!
112,what’s going on at is happening to different degrees at other networks - with being the worst. the good news is that andy lack(y) is about to be fired(?) for incompetence and much worse. when lester holt got caught fudging my tape on russia they were hurt badly!
113,“hillary clinton and the dnc paid for information from the russian government to use against her government - there’s no doubt about that!”
114,report just out: “china hacked hillary clinton’s private email server.” are they sure it wasn’t russia (just kidding!)? what are the odds that the fbi and doj are right on top of this? actually a very big story. much classified information!
115,....fisa abuse christopher steele &amp; his phony and corrupt dossier the clinton foundation illegal surveillance of trump campaign russian collusion by dems - and so much more. open up the papers &amp; documents without redaction? come on jeff you can do it the country is waiting!
116,disgraced and discredited bob mueller and his whole group of angry democrat thugs spent over hours with the white house councel only with my approval for purposes of transparency. anybody needing that much time when they know there is no russian collusion is just someone....
117,all of the fools that are so focused on looking only at russia should start also looking in another direction china. but in the end if we are smart tough and well prepared we will get along with everyone!
118,“fox news has learned that bruce ohr wrote christopher steele following the firing of james comey saying that he was afraid the anti-trump russia probe will be exposed.” charles payne how much more does mueller have to see? they have blinders on - rigged!
119,“while steele shopped the document to multiple media outlets he also asked for help with a russian oligarch.” catherine herridge of in other words they were colluding with russia!
120,mark levin “when they had power they didn’t stop the russians the chinese the north koreans they funded the iranians &amp; are responsible for the greatest scandal in american history by interfering with our election &amp; trying to undermine the trump campaign and trump presidency.”
121,the rigged russian witch hunt goes on and on as the “originators and founders” of this scam continue to be fired and demoted for their corrupt and illegal activity. all credibility is gone from this terrible hoax and much more will be lost as it proceeds. no collusion!
122,lou dobbs: “this cannot go forward...this special counsel with all of his conflicts with his angry democrats without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia. the dems are the ones who should be investigated.” thank you lou so true!
123,fired fbi agent peter strzok is a fraud as is the rigged investigation he started. there was no collusion or obstruction with russia and everybody including the democrats know it. the only collusion and obstruction was by crooked hillary the democrats and the dnc!
124,lou dobbs: “this cannot go forward...this special councel with all of his conflicts with his angry democrats without any evidence of collusion by the trump campaign and russia. the dems are the ones who should be investigated.” thank you lou so true!
125,.@mariabartiromo “no evidence to launch even an investigation into potential collusion between donald trump and the russians - and here we are a year and a half later.”
126,“there has been no evidence whatsoever that donald trump or the campaign was involved in any kind of collusion to fix the election. in fact the evidence is the opposite that hillary clinton &amp; the democrats colluded with the russians to fix the election.”
127,....a law firm eventually kremlin connected sources to gather info on donald trump. collusion is very real with russia but only with hillary and the democrats and we should demand a full investigation.” dan bongino on looking forward to the new ig report!
128,“collusion with russia was very real. hillary clinton and her team % colluded with the russians and so did adam schiff who is on tape trying to collude with what he thought was russians to obtain compromising material on djt. we also know that hillary clinton paid through....
129,...dianne is the person leading our nation on “collusion” with russia (only done by dems). will she now investigate herself?
130,congratulations to gregg jarrett on his book “the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump” going to # on and amazon. it is indeed a hoax and witch hunt illegally started by people who have already been disgraced. great book!
131,congratulations to on the tremendous success of his just out book “the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton &amp; frame donald trump.” already number one on amazon. hard work from a brilliant guy. it’s the real story of the rigged witch hunt!
132,“we already have a smoking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was hillary clinton. how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is bad?” marc thiessen washington post
133,looking back on history who was treated worse alfonse capone legendary mob boss killer and “public enemy number one” or paul manafort political operative &amp; reagan/dole darling now serving solitary confinement - although convicted of nothing? where is the russian collusion?
134,“we already have a smocking gun about a campaign getting dirt on their opponent it was hillary clinton. how is it ok for hillary clinton to proactively seek dirt from the russians but the trump campaign met at the russians request and that is bad?” marc thiessen washington post
135,russian collusion with the trump campaign one of the most successful in history is a total hoax. the democrats paid for the phony and discredited dossier which was along with comey mccabe strzok and his lover the lovely lisa page used to begin the witch hunt. disgraceful!
136,....also why is mueller only appointing angry dems some of whom have worked for crooked hillary others including himself have worked for obama....and why isn’t mueller looking at all of the criminal activity &amp; real russian collusion on the democrats side-podesta dossier?
137,....the only collusion with russia was with the democrats so now they are looking at my tweets (along with million other people) - the rigged witch hunt continues! how stupid and unfair to our country....and so the fake news doesn’t waste my time with dumb questions no....
138,“the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton &amp; frame donald trump” is a hot seller already number one! more importantly it is a great book that everyone is talking about. it covers the rigged witch hunt brilliantly. congratulations to gregg jarrett!
139,i’m very concerned that russia will be fighting very hard to have an impact on the upcoming election. based on the fact that no president has been tougher on russia than me they will be pushing very hard for the democrats. they definitely don’t want trump!
140,.....”carter page wasn’t a spy wasn’t an agent of the russians - he would have cooperated with the fbi. it was a fraud and a hoax designed to target trump.” tom fitton a disgrace to america. they should drop the discredited mueller witch hunt now!
141,so president obama knew about russia before the election. why didn’t he do something about it? why didn’t he tell our campaign? because it is all a big hoax that’s why and he thought crooked hillary was going to win!!!
142,“trump recognized russian meddling many times”
143,“trump recognized russian meddling many times.”
144,the summit with russia was a great success except with the real enemy of the people the fake news media. i look forward to our second meeting so that we can start implementing some of the many things discussed including stopping terrorism security for israel nuclear........
145,“trump recognized russian meddling many times.” thank you to and for actually showing the clips. the fake news wants no part of that narrative! too bad they don’t want to focus on all of the economic and jobs records being set.
146,the fake news media wants so badly to see a major confrontation with russia even a confrontation that could lead to war. they are pushing so recklessly hard and hate the fact that i’ll probably have a good relationship with putin. we are doing much better than any other country!
147,some people hate the fact that i got along well with president putin of russia. they would rather go to war than see this. it’s called trump derangement syndrome!
148,....russia has agreed to help with north korea where relationships with us are very good and the process is moving along. there is no rush the sanctions remain! big benefits and exciting future for north korea at end of process!
149,while the nato meeting in brussels was an acknowledged triumph with billions of dollars more being put up by member countries at a faster pace the meeting with russia may prove to be in the long run an even greater success. many positive things will come out of that meeting..
150,while i had a great meeting with nato raising vast amounts of money i had an even better meeting with vladimir putin of russia. sadly it is not being reported that way - the fake news is going crazy!
151,i had a great meeting with nato. they have paid $ billion more and will pay hundreds of billions of dollars more in the future only because of me. nato was weak but now it is strong again (bad for russia). the media only says i was rude to leaders never mentions the money!
152,a productive dialogue is not only good for the united states and good for russia but it is good for the world. #
153,our relationship with russia has never been worse thanks to many years of u.s. foolishness and stupidity and now the rigged witch hunt!
154,president obama thought that crooked hillary was going to win the election so when he was informed by the fbi about russian meddling he said it couldn’t happen was no big deal &amp; did nothing about it. when i won it became a big deal and the rigged witch hunt headed by strzok!
155,congratulations to france who played extraordinary soccer on winning the world cup. additionally congratulations to president putin and russia for putting on a truly great world cup tournament -- one of the best ever!
156,heading to helsinki finland – looking forward to meeting with president putin tomorrow. unfortunately no matter how well i do at the summit if i was given the great city of moscow as retribution for all of the sins and evils committed by russia...
157,these russian individuals did their work during the obama years. why didn’t obama do something about it? because he thought crooked hillary clinton would win that’s why. had nothing to do with the trump administration but fake news doesn’t want to report the truth as usual!
158,the stories you heard about the russians yesterday took place during the obama administration not the trump administration. why didn’t they do something about it especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september before the election?
159,the stories you heard about the russians yesterday took place during the obama administration not the trump administrations. why didn’t they do something about it especially when it was reported that president obama was informed by the fbi in september before the election?
160,....on top of it all germany just started paying russia the country they want protection from billions of dollars for their energy needs coming out of a new pipeline from russia. not acceptable! all nato nations must meet their % commitment and that must ultimately go to %!
161,presidents have been trying unsuccessfully for years to get germany and other rich nato nations to pay more toward their protection from russia. they pay only a fraction of their cost. the u.s. pays tens of billions of dollars too much to subsidize europe and loses big on trade!
162,billions of additional dollars are being spent by nato countries since my visit last year at my request but it isn’t nearly enough. u.s. spends too much. europe’s borders are bad! pipeline dollars to russia are not acceptable!
163,what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? why are there only out of countries that have met their commitment? the u.s. is paying for europe’s protection then loses billions on trade. must pay % of gdp immediately not by .
164,what good is nato if germany is paying russia billions of dollars for gas and energy? why are their only out of countries that have met their commitment? the u.s. is paying for europe’s protection then loses billions on trade. must pay % of gdp immediately not by .
165,public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the “special” counsel because the public understands that there was no collusion with russia (so ridiculous) that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation &amp; that the only collusion was with the dems!
166,public opinion has turned strongly against the rigged witch hunt and the “special” councel because the public understands that there was no collusion with russia (so ridiculous) that the two fbi lovers were a fraud against our nation &amp; that the only collusion was with the dems!
167,just won lawsuit filed by the dnc and a bunch of democrat crazies trying to claim the trump campaign (and others) colluded with russia. they haven’t figured out that this was an excuse for them losing the election!
168,russia continues to say they had nothing to do with meddling in our election! where is the dnc server and why didn’t shady james comey and the now disgraced fbi agents take and closely examine it? why isn’t hillary/russia being looked at? so many questions so much corruption!
169,major wall street journal opinion piece today talking about the russian witch hunt and the disgrace that it is. so many people hurt so bad for our country - a total sham!
170,the russian witch hunt is rigged!
171,.@foxnews poll numbers plummet on the democrat inspired and paid for russian witch hunt. with all of the bias lying and hate by the investigators people want the investigators investigated. much more will come out. a total scam and excuse for the dems losing the election!
172,witch hunt! there was no russian collusion. oh i see there was no russian collusion so now they look for obstruction on the no russian collusion. the phony russian collusion was a made up hoax. too bad they didn’t look at crooked hillary like this. double standard!
173,fbi agent peter strzok who headed the clinton &amp; russia investigations texted to his lover lisa page in the ig report that “we’ll stop” candidate trump from becoming president. doesn’t get any lower than that!
174,so the democrats make up a phony crime collusion with the russians pay a fortune to make the crime sound real illegally leak (comey) classified information so that a special councel will be appointed and then collude to make this pile of garbage take on life in fake news!
175,i am heading for canada and the g- for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the united states. from there i go to singapore and talks with north korea on denuclearization. won’t be talking about the russian witch hunt hoax for a while!
176,the russian witch hunt hoax continues all because jeff sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself...i would have quickly picked someone else. so much time and money wasted so many lives ruined...and sessions knew better than most that there was no collusion!
177,the fake news media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony russian witch hunt.
178,there was no collusion with russia (except by the democrats). when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end? so bad for our country. is the special counsel/justice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media? should be looking at dems corruption instead?
179,there was no collusion with russia (except by the democrats). when will this very expensive witch hunt hoax ever end? so bad for our country. is the special councel/justice department leaking my lawyers letters to the fake news media? should be looking at dems corruption instead?
180,....“$ million spent it’s a scam investigation. americans are being worked. we now know there was russian collusion with russians and the democrats. the mueller team is stacked with anti-trumpers who actually represented clinton people (&amp; gave $’s to crooked h).” dan bongino
181,a.p. has just reported that the russian hoax investigation has now cost our government over $ million and going up fast. no collusion except by the democrats!
182,not that it matters but i never fired james comey because of russia! the corrupt mainstream media loves to keep pushing that narrative but they know it is not true!
183,rush limbaugh “if the fbi was so concerned and if they weren’t targeting trump they should have told trump. if they were really concerned about the russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax) then why not try to stop it? why not tell trump? because they were pushing this scam.”
184,the soon to be released book “the russia hoax the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump” written by gregg jarrett looks like a real deal big hit. the phony witch hunt will be opened up for the world to see! out in weeks.
185,sorry i’ve got to start focusing my energy on north korea nuclear bad trade deals va choice the economy rebuilding the military and so much more and not on the rigged russia witch hunt that should be investigating clinton/russia/fbi/justice/obama/comey/lynch etc.
186,the angry democrats (plus people who worked years for obama) working on the rigged russia witch hunt will be meddling with the mid-term elections especially now that republicans (stay tough!) are taking the lead in polls. there was no collusion except by the democrats!
187,why didn’t president obama do something about the so-called russian meddling when he was told about it by the fbi before the election? because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart! he was in charge not me and did nothing.
188,why didn’t the angry democrats investigate the campaign of crooked hillary clinton many crimes much collusion with russia? why didn’t the fbi take the server from the dnc? rigged investigation!
189,who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony russia collusion witch hunt? they journeyed down to washington d.c. with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation...they went back home in tatters!
190,when will the angry democrats (&amp; those who worked for president o) reveal their disqualifying conflicts of interest? it’s been a long time now! will they be indelibly written into the report along with the fact that the only collusion is with the dems justice fbi &amp; russia?
191,this whole russia probe is rigged. just an excuse as to why the dems and crooked hillary lost the election and states that haven’t been lost in decades. angry democrats and all dems if you include the people who worked for obama for years. #spygate &amp; conflicts of interest!
192,with spies or “informants” as the democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not) all over my campaign even from a very early date why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the fbi or “justice” contact me to tell me of the phony russia problem?
193,the democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a spy as illegal as that may be. but what about an “informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the russian hoax?
194,look how things have turned around on the criminal deep state. they go after phony collusion with russia a made up scam and end up getting caught in a major spy scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before! what goes around comes around!
195,...follow the money! the spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported collusion with russia because there was no collusion. he was only there to spy for political reasons and to help crooked hillary win - just like they did to bernie sanders who got duped!
196,the witch hunt finds no collusion with russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the world. oh’ great!
197,now that the witch hunt has given up on russia and is looking at the rest of the world they should easily be able to take it into the mid-term elections where they can put some hurt on the republican party. don’t worry about dems fisa abuse missing emails or fraudulent dossier!
198,....at what point does this soon to be $ witch hunt composed of angry and heavily conflicted democrats and two people who have worked for obama for years stop! they have found no collussion with russia no obstruction but they aren’t looking at the corruption...
199,things are really getting ridiculous. the failing and crooked (but not as crooked as hillary clinton) has done a long &amp; boring story indicating that the world’s most expensive witch hunt has found nothing on russia &amp; me so now they are looking at the rest of the world!
200,reports are there was indeed at least one fbi representative implanted for political purposes into my campaign for president. it took place very early on and long before the phony russia hoax became a “hot” fake news story. if true - all time biggest political scandal!
201,can you believe that with all of the made up unsourced stories i get from the fake news media together with the $ russian witch hunt (there is no collusion) i now have my best poll numbers in a year. much of the media may be corrupt but the people truly get it!
202,the angry democrats in charge of the russian witch hunt are starting to find out that there is a court system in place that actually protects people from injustice...and just wait ‘till the courts get to see your unrevealed conflicts of interest!
203,the russia witch hunt is rapidly losing credibility. house intelligence committee found no collusion coordination or anything else with russia. so now the probe says ok what else is there? how about obstruction for a made up phony crime.there is no o it’s called fighting back
204,“this isn’t some game. you are screwing with the work of the president of the united states.” john dowd march . with north korea china the middle east and so much more there is not much time to be thinking about this especially since there was no russian “collusion.”
205,new book - a must read! “the russia hoax - the illicit scheme to clear hillary clinton and frame donald trump” by the brilliant fox news legal analyst gregg jarrett. a sad chapter for law enforcement. a rigged system!
206,so disgraceful that the questions concerning the russian witch hunt were “leaked” to the media. no questions on collusion. oh i see...you have a made up phony crime collusion that never existed and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information. nice!
207,secret service has just informed me that senator jon tester’s statements on admiral jackson are not true. there were no such findings. a horrible thing that we in d.c. must live with just like phony russian collusion. tester should lose race in montana. very dishonest and sick!
208,house intelligence committee rules that there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia. as i have been saying all along it is all a big hoax by the democrats based on payments and lies. there should never have been a special counsel appointed. witch hunt!
209,house intelligence committee rules that there was no collusion between the trump campaign and russia. as i have been saying all along it is all a big hoax by the democrats based on payments and lies. there should never have been a special councel appointed. witch hunt!
210,just out: house intelligence committee report released. “no evidence” that the trump campaign “colluded coordinated or conspired with russia.” clinton campaign paid for opposition research obtained from russia- wow! a total witch hunt! must end now!
211,slippery james comey the worst fbi director in history was not fired because of the phony russia investigation where by the way there was no collusion (except by the dems)!
212,russia and china are playing the currency devaluation game as the u.s. keeps raising interest rates. not acceptable!
213,much of the bad blood with russia is caused by the fake &amp; corrupt russia investigation headed up by the all democrat loyalists or people that worked for obama. mueller is most conflicted of all (except rosenstein who signed fisa &amp; comey letter). no collusion so they go crazy!
214,our relationship with russia is worse now than it has ever been and that includes the cold war. there is no reason for this. russia needs us to help with their economy something that would be very easy to do and we need all nations to work together. stop the arms race?
215,russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at syria. get ready russia because they will be coming nice and new and “smart!” you shouldn’t be partners with a gas killing animal who kills his people and enjoys it!
216,....doing things that nobody thought possible despite the never ending and corrupt russia investigation which takes tremendous time and focus. no collusion or obstruction (other than i fight back) so now they do the unthinkable and raid a lawyers office for information! bad!
217,the failing new york times wrote another phony story. it was political pundit doug schoen not a ukrainian businessman who asked me to do a short speech by phone (skype) hosted by doug in ukraine. i was very positive about ukraine-another negative to the fake russia c story!
218,many dead including women and children in mindless chemical attack in syria. area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by syrian army making it completely inaccessible to outside world. president putin russia and iran are responsible for backing animal assad. big price...
219,....lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more) which is unfair to our great country - and i am very happy with my existing team. besides there was no collusion with russia except by crooked hillary and the dems!
220,many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the russia case...don’t believe the fake news narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on. fame &amp; fortune will never be turned down by a lawyer though some are conflicted. problem is that a new......
221,house intelligence committee votes to release final report. findings: () no evidence provided of collusion between trump campaign &amp; russia. () the obama administrations post election response was insufficient. () clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts.
222,i called president putin of russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past obama called him also). the fake news media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him. they are wrong! getting along with russia (and others) is a good thing not a bad thing.......
223,as the house intelligence committee has concluded there was no collusion between russia and the trump campaign. as many are now finding out however there was tremendous leaking lying and corruption at the highest levels of the fbi justice &amp; state. #draintheswamp
224,the house intelligence committee has after a month long in-depth investigation found no evidence of collusion or coordination between the trump campaign and russia to influence the presidential election.
225,...have shown conclusively that there was no collusion with russia..just excuse for losing. the only collusion was that done by the dnc the democrats and crooked hillary. the writer of the story maggie haberman a hillary flunky knows nothing about me and is not given access.
226,the failing new york times purposely wrote a false story stating that i am unhappy with my legal team on the russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out. wrong. i am very happy with my lawyers john dowd ty cobb and jay sekulow. they are doing a great job and.....
227,why did the obama administration start an investigation into the trump campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the election in november? wanted to discredit so crooked h would win. unprecedented. bigger than watergate! plus obama did nothing about russian meddling.
228,“russians had no compromising information on donald trump” of course not because there is none and never was. this whole witch hunt is an illegal disgrace...and obama did nothing about russia!
229,question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration right up to january why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? why didn’t obama do something about the meddling? why aren’t dem crimes under investigation? ask jeff sessions!
230,question: if all of the russian meddling took place during the obama administration right up to january why aren’t they the subject of the investigation? why didn’t obama do something about the meddling? why aren’t dem crimes under investigation? ask jeff session!
231,bad ratings &amp; got scammed when they covered the anti-trump russia rally wall-to-wall. they probably knew it was fake news but because it was a rally against me they pushed it hard anyway. two really dishonest newscasters but the public is wise!
232,i have been much tougher on russia than obama just look at the facts. total fake news!
233,....the president obama quote just before election. that’s because he thought crooked hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat.” when i easily won the electoral college the whole game changed and the russian excuse became the narrative of the dems.
234,thank you to for the great timeline on all of the failures the obama administration had against russia including crimea syria and so much more. we are now starting to win again!
235,obama was president up to and beyond the election. so why didn’t he do something about russian meddling?
236,thank you to kenstarr former independent counsel whitewater for your insight and powerful words on fisa abuse russian meddling etc. really great interview with
237,if it was the goal of russia to create discord disruption and chaos within the u.s. then with all of the committee hearings investigations and party hatred they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams. they are laughing their asses off in moscow. get smart america!
238,now that adam schiff is starting to blame president obama for russian meddling in the election he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the democrats lead by their fearless leader crooked hillary clinton lost the election. but wasn’t i a great candidate?
239,i never said russia did not meddle in the election i said “it may be russia or china or another country or group or it may be a pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer.” the russian “hoax” was that the trump campaign colluded with russia - it never did!
240,finally liddle’ adam schiff the leakin’ monster of no control is now blaming the obama administration for russian meddling in the election. he is finally right about something. obama was president knew of the threat and did nothing. thank you adam!
241,general mcmaster forgot to say that the results of the election were not impacted or changed by the russians and that the only collusion was between russia and crooked h the dnc and the dems. remember the dirty dossier uranium speeches emails and the podesta company!
242,very sad that the fbi missed all of the many signals sent out by the florida school shooter. this is not acceptable. they are spending too much time trying to prove russian collusion with the trump campaign - there is no collusion. get back to the basics and make us all proud!
243,“i have seen all of the russian ads and i can say very definitively that swaying the election was *not* the main goal.”rob goldmanvice president of facebook ads
244,funny how the fake news media doesn’t want to say that the russian group was formed in long before my run for president. maybe they knew i was going to run even though i didn’t know!
245,“charges deal don a big win” written by michael goodwin of the succinctly states that “the russians had no impact on the election results.” there was no collusion with the trump campaign. “she lost the old-fashioned way by being a terrible candidate. case closed.”
246,russia started their anti-us campaign in long before i announced that i would run for president. the results of the election were not impacted. the trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion!
247,according to the a russian sold phony secrets on “trump” to the u.s. asking price was $ million brought down to $ million to be paid over time. i hope people are now seeing &amp; understanding what is going on here. it is all now starting to come out - drain the swamp!
248,wow! -senator mark warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a russian oligarch. warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in london) he requested with steele of fraudulent dossier fame. all tied into crooked hillary.
249,great jobs numbers and finally after many years rising wages- and nobody even talks about them. only russia russia russia despite the fact that after a year of looking there is no collusion!
250,this memo totally vindicates “trump” in probe. but the russian witch hunt goes on and on. their was no collusion and there was no obstruction (the word now used because after one year of looking endlessly and finding nothing collusion is dead). this is an american disgrace!
251,do you notice the fake news mainstream media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative. the russian collusion hoax is dead except as it pertains to the dems. public gets it!
252,disproven and paid for by democrats “dossier used to spy on trump campaign. did fbi use intel tool to influence the election?” did dems or clinton also pay russians? where are hidden and smashed dnc servers? where are crooked hillary emails? what a mess!
253,the single greatest witch hunt in american history continues. there was no collusion everybody including the dems knows there was no collusion &amp; yet on and on it goes. russia &amp; the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing. republicans should finally take control!
254,the fact that sneaky dianne feinstein who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between trump/russia has not been found would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way totally without authorization is a disgrace. must have tough primary!
255,now that russian collusion after one year of intense study has proven to be a total hoax on the american public the democrats and their lapdogs the fake news mainstream media are taking out the old ronald reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence.....
256,well now that collusion with russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with hillary clinton and the fbi/russia the fake news media (mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable. they should try winning an election. sad!
257,while the fake news loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating just showed that my rating on dec. was approximately the same as president obama on dec. which was %...and this despite massive negative trump coverage &amp; russia hoax!
258,wow “dossier is bogus. clinton campaign dnc funded dossier. fbi cannot (after all of this time) verify claims in dossier of russia/trump collusion. fbi tainted.” and they used this crooked hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the trump campaign!
259,despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent the democrats have been unable to show any collusion with russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who i don’t know and/or have never met. fake news!
260,congratulations to news for suspending brian ross for his horrendously inaccurate and dishonest report on the russia russia russia witch hunt. more networks and “papers” should do the same with their fake news!
261,the chinese envoy who just returned from north korea seems to have had no impact on little rocket man. hard to believe his people and the military put up with living in such horrible conditions. russia and china condemned the launch.
262,since the first day i took office all you hear is the phony democrat excuse for losing the election russia russiarussia. despite this i have the economy booming and have possibly done more than any month president. make america great again!
263,does the fake news media remember when crooked hillary clinton as secretary of state was begging russia to be our friend with the misspelled reset button? obama tried also but he had zero chemistry with putin.
264,when will all the haters and fools out there realize that having a good relationship with russia is a good thing not a bad thing. there always playing politics - bad for our country. i want to solve north korea syria ukraine terrorism and russia can greatly help!
265,met with president putin of russia who was at #apec meetings. good discussions on syria. hope for his help to solve along with china the dangerous north korea crisis. progress being made.
266,"all of this ""russia"" talk right when the republicans are making their big push for historic tax cuts &amp; reform. is this coincidental? not!"
267,...the uranium to russia deal the plus deleted emails the comey fix and so much more. instead they look at phony trump/russia....
268,“what happened”“how team hillary played the press for fools on russia”➡️ we know!
269,.@foxnews chris wallace: “more evidence of dem collusion with russia than gop”

273,uranium deal to russia with clinton help and obama administration knowledge is the biggest story that fake media doesn't want to follow!
274,the russia hoax continues now it's ads on facebook. what about the totally biased and dishonest media coverage in favor of crooked hillary?
275,according to report just out president obama knew about russian interference years ago but he didn't want to anger russia!
276,interesting to watch senator richard blumenthal of connecticut talking about hoax russian collusion when he was a phony vietnam con artist!
277,...and west virginia. the fact is the fake news russian collusion story record stock market border security military strength jobs.....
278,the united nations security council just voted - to sanction north korea. china and russia voted with us. very big financial impact!
279,our relationship with russia is at an all-time &amp; very dangerous low. you can thank congress the same people that can't even give us hcare!
280,in other words russia was against trump in the election - and why not i want strong military &amp; low oil prices. witch hunt!
281,"one of the things that has been lost in the politics of this situation is that the russians collected and spread negative information.....jared kushner did very well yesterday in proving he did not collude with the russians. witch hunt. next up year old barron trump!sleazy adam schiff the totally biased congressman looking into russia"" spends all of his time on television pushing the dem loss excuse!"
282,so why aren't the committees and investigators and of course our beleaguered a.g. looking into crooked hillarys crimes &amp; russia relations?
283,"after year of investigation with zero evidence being found chuck schumer just stated that ""democrats should blame ourselvesnot russia."""
284,as the phony russian witch hunt continues two groups are laughing at this excuse for a lost election taking hold democrats and russians!
285,...what about all of the clinton ties to russia including podesta company uranium deal russian reset big dollar speeches etc.
286,thank you to former campaign adviser michael caputo for saying so powerfully that there was no russian collusion in our winning campaign.
287,stock market hit another all-time high yesterday - despite the russian hoax story! also jobs numbers are starting to look very good!
288,...we negotiated a ceasefire in parts of syria which will save lives. now it is time to move forward in working constructively with russia!
289,i strongly pressed president putin twice about russian meddling in our election. he vehemently denied it. i've already given my opinion.....
290,fake news cnn is looking at big management changes now that they got caught falsely pushing their phony russian stories. ratings way down!
291,"wow cnn had to retract big story on ""russia"" with employees forced to resign. what about all the other phony stories they do? fake news!"
292,the real story is that president obama did nothing after being informed in august about russian meddling. with months looking at russia...
293,the reason that president obama did nothing about russia after being notified by the cia of meddling is that he expected clinton would win..
294,"obama administration official said they ""choked"" when it came to acting on russian meddling of election. they didn't want to hurt hillary?"
295,since the obama administration was told way before the election that the russians were meddling why no action? focus on them not t!
296,just out: the obama administration knew far in advance of november about election meddling by russia. did nothing about it. why?
297,by the way if russia was working so hard on the election it all took place during the obama admin. why didn't they stop them?
298,former homeland security advisor jeh johnson is latest top intelligence official to state there was no grand scheme between trump &amp; russia.
299,"after months of investigations &amp; committee hearings about my ""collusion with the russians"" nobody has been able to show any proof. sad!"
